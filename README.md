> CSS Variables, No Compile, Bootstrap Classes

## ‚òùÔ∏è Why another fork of Bootstrap??
I believe that Bootstrap is a comprehensive **CSS framework**, ready to use out of the box. 
It's used in various ways, sometimes compiled and often through a CDN. Basic CSS rules (like fonts and colors) are sometimes overwritten via a new CSS file.

According to recent developments in **CSS compatibility**, it's possible to use Bootstrap without having to compile the code, while still retaining the ability to easily customize certain parameters.

The **native CSS variables** have also revolutionized my approach.

## üëå Simplify and customize
The code used for this project is taken from **Bootstrap, version v. 5.3**, with the addition of a modern approach.

So, **all the classes** of the framework can be used; for all information regarding the usage of the components, refer to the Bootstrap website.


## üññ My approach!
Using some simple native CSS variables, it's possible to quickly customize Bootstrap.

- No compile required
- Native CSS variables
- BS convention
- Simple and sustainable

Everything you need to set up for **quick customization** is readily available within the CSS file. Few and clear variables tailored for various uses. No need for compile and ready for preview.

### Customize
Primary color, Secondary color, Font color, Link color, Font family, Font size, Border radius
